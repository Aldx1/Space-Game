# Space game 

Space game built in C++ for a University project. 

You should be able to clone the code and run the executable from the Release folder. 

If you try to build the project in Visual Studio you may have a few linking errors. 
Potentital fix:
"Properties" -> "C/C++" -> "General" and add the relevant include path under "Additional Include Directories".
